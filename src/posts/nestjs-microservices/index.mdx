## Prerequisites

First of all, you need to install the Nest CLI via node package manager.

```bash
npm i -g @nestjs/cli
```

Create a new project call order-microservice, you can choose any package manager you like.
In this post I'll use `yarn` 

```typescript
import { NestFactory } from "@nestjs/core";
import { Transport } from "@nestjs/microservices";

async function bootstrap() {
  const app = await NestFactory.createMicroservice<MicroserviceOptions>(
    AppModule,
    microserviceOptions
  )
}
bootstrap()
```
